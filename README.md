###  Random Numbers | Exercise-Sheet 1
Write a program that keeps printing integers between 0 and 50 until the number 42 appears. 
Print the total number of generated integers at the end.

###  Hamming-Distance | Exercise-Sheet 1
Given to strings of same length, calculate their `Hamming-Distance`.

### First Occurrence | Exercise-Sheet 2
Given a long text `String T`, a shorter pattern `String s`, and an `integer k`, give an algorithm that finds the first occurrence in `T` of a string (if any) `s'` such that $$d_H(s, s' ) â‰¤ k$$ What is the complexity of your algorithm? `O(len(T) * len(s))`
